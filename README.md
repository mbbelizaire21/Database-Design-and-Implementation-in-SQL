# Database-Design-and-Implementation-in-SQL
## Designing a database and performing exploratory data analysis in Microsoft SQL Server for a laundromat business.

3 Boys Enterprises Laundromat, a family-owned business located in Spring Valley, New York, has been operating since 2010. Over the years, the business has grown, but its methods for tracking customer purchases, inventory, drop-off services, employee data, and customer laundromat cards have remained inefficient. To address these challenges, we have developed an all-encompassing database that streamlines data management, making it easier to store and retrieve relevant information. This project aims to improve the operational efficiency of 3 Boys Enterprises Laundromat by providing an efficient, reliable, and secure database system

* The project will involve designing and building an all-encompassing database to store and retrieve customer purchase data, inventory/stock data, drop-off service customer information, employee data, and customer laundromat card data.
* The database will be designed based on the business rules defined for the project, such as mandatory and optional data fields for customers, employees, and suppliers.
* The database will be implemented using Microsoft SQL Server, a popular database management system, which will enable efficient storage and retrieval of data.
* Queries will be created to answer specific data questions, such as how much revenue is generated from washers and dryers on a given day, the average weight of drop-off service clothes, and which employees complete the most transactions.
* The project will involve testing and validation of the database to ensure that it can handle large amounts of data and provide accurate and reliable results.
